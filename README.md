📰 Fake News Detection using Machine LearningOverviewThis project presents a robust Machine Learning model designed to classify news articles as either True or Fake. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the goal is to build an effective automated system to combat the spread of misinformation and enhance digital literacy.Key Features & GoalsData Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing raw news text data for model consumption.Text Vectorization: Utilizing the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technique to convert text into numerical feature vectors.Model Implementation: Training a Logistic Regression classifier, a highly effective and interpretable model for text classification tasks.Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance on unseen data using standard metrics.Manual Testing: Functionality for testing the model on new, user-inputted articles in real-time.Technologies and LibrariesThis project is built using Python and the following key libraries:CategoryLibraryPurposeData Manipulationpandas, numpyData cleaning, structuring, and numerical operations.Machine Learningscikit-learnModel building, training, and evaluation (Logistic Regression, TF-IDF).Data Visualizationmatplotlib, seabornExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualizing model results.CorePython 3.xProgramming language.Model and MethodologyThe core of this project is a Logistic Regression model. While simple, it often provides excellent baseline performance on large text classification datasets.Data Labeling: The provided datasets are structured with explicit labels (True or Fake).Tokenization & Feature Extraction: The text content ('title' and 'text' columns) is processed using the TfidfVectorizer to weight the importance of words based on their frequency in individual documents versus the entire corpus.Training: The Logistic Regression algorithm is trained on these TF-IDF vectors to learn the patterns that differentiate true news from fake news.Getting StartedPrerequisitesTo run this notebook, you will need a Python environment with the following libraries installed:Bashpip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Open the Notebook:The project is contained within the Jupyter Notebook: Fake News Detection1.ipynb. Open it using Jupyter or an IDE like VS Code.Bashjupyter notebook Fake News Detection1.ipynb
Execute Cells: Run the cells sequentially to load the data, train the model, evaluate the results, and finally test new articles using the manual testing function.
