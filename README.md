Fake News Detection (Machine Learning)

This project classifies news articles as Real or Fake using Python, NumPy, Pandas, and various machine learning models. It processes text data, extracts features using TF-IDF, trains multiple classifiers, and evaluates their accuracy.

Features

Data cleaning & preprocessing

TF-IDF feature extraction

Multiple ML models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Passive Aggressive Classifier

Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

Prediction on custom user input

Technologies Used

Python

NumPy, Pandas

Scikit-learn

NLTK (optional for text cleaning)

Results

Logistic Regression and Passive Aggressive Classifier achieve the highest accuracy (~90–95%).

Future Improvements

Deep learning models (LSTM)

Streamlit/Flask interface

Real-time prediction API
